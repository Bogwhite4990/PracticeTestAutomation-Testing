# PracticeTestAutomation-Testing
Some basic testing using CypressJS

PracticeTestAutomation is a website for practicing test automation, and this GitHub repository contains Cypress code for testing the website. The code includes four tests that check different aspects of the website's functionality. The first two tests check if the website correctly handles incorrect usernames and passwords. The third test checks if a user with a correct username and password can access the website. The fourth test checks if the website's Log out button works correctly.
